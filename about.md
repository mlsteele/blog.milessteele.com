I am a digital artist, programmer, and unicyclist located in Amherst, MA. I work with open source software whenever I can. Things I've played with (and enjoyed) include Blender 3D, Gimp, Inkscape, Processing, imageJ, Context Free, Arduino, Java, Javascript, Scala, Python, C, and C++.

I want to be able to wave my hands in the air and tell stories. Somewhere along the chain from memory to expression to communication someone always manages to fumble a piece here or there. I believe in the coordination of physical systems, computational interpretation, and artistic expression into a new kind of link between people.
